#Here I am going to compute the daily cumulative sum of sales. 
SELECT *, sum(count) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
       bat_sales_growth FROM bat_sales_daily
       
       
#I am going to use a  7-day lag function of the sum column and insert all the columns of bat_ sales_daily and the new lag column into a new table.
This lag column indicates what the sales were like 1 week before the given record:
SELECT *, lag(sum, 7) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
       bat_sales_daily_delay FROM bat_sales_growth;
       
#I am going to use the sales growth as a percentage, comparing the current sales volume to that of 1 week prior.
#SELECT *, (sum-lag)/lag AS volume INTO bat_sales_delay_vol FROM
      bat_sales_daily_delay
      
(Looking at the output table, we can see four sets of information: 
the daily sales count, the cumulative sum of the daily sales count, the cumulative sum offset by 1 week (the lag), and the relative daily sales volume.
