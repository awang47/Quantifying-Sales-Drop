#Here I am going to compute the daily cumulative sum of sales. 
SELECT *, sum(count) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
       bat_sales_growth FROM bat_sales_daily
       
       
#I am going to use a  7-day lag function of the sum column and insert all the columns of bat_ sales_daily and the new lag column into a new table.
This lag column indicates what the sales were like 1 week before the given record:
SELECT *, lag(sum, 7) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
       bat_sales_daily_delay FROM bat_sales_growth;
       
#I am going to use the sales growth as a percentage, comparing the current sales volume to that of 1 week prior.
#SELECT *, (sum-lag)/lag AS volume INTO bat_sales_delay_vol FROM
      bat_sales_daily_delay
      
(Looking at the output table, we can see four sets of information: 
the daily sales count, the cumulative sum of the daily sales count, the cumulative sum offset by 1 week (the lag), and the relative daily sales volume.

Analysis:
With the lag and volume columns, I can now identify the drops in sales growth over the first couple of weeks. I compared the daily sum of sales to the same values 7 days earlier. 
By subtracting the sum and lag values and dividing by the lag, we obtain the volume value and can determine sales growth compared to the previous week.
By October 22, the volume doubled that of the week prior. As time passes, this relative difference begins to decrease dramatically.
By the end of October, the volume is 28% higher than the week prior. Now, we have confirmed the presence of a reduction in sales growth of bat scotter after the first 2 weeks.
